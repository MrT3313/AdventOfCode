# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

# Languages Used

My main languages are Javascript/Typescript & Python but I am using these challenges (starting in 2024) to dip my toes into some other languages like Zig, Ocaml, Rust, GO etc...
